Business Problems
Instagram's database is designed to address the following business problems:
	•	Understanding audience engagement: Influencers may learn more about how their audience is interacting with their content by studying post data. Metrics like likes, comments, and shares fall under this category. Influencers may use this information to better target their content to audience preferences and increase engagement rates.
	•	Evaluating content performance: Businesses may assess the effectiveness of their content over time by using post metrics. Businesses may determine which types of content are engaging with their audience and modify their content strategy by monitoring data like reach, impressions, and engagement rates.
	•	Identifying top-performing content: Influencers may determine which posts are doing the best by looking at post analytics, and they can use this knowledge to drive their content strategy. This can contain stats like the most popular content.
	•	Benchmarking against competitors: Influencers may learn about market trends and pinpoint areas for development by tracking post data for both their own material and that of their rivals. Metrics like average engagement rates and follower growth rates might be a part of this.
 
Design Requirements (Credit to Professor Simon Wang):
• Use Crow's Foot Notation.
• Specify the primary key fields in each table by specifying PK beside the fields.
Draw a line between the fields of each table to show the relationships between each table. This line should be pointed directly to the fields in each table that are used to form the relationship.
• Specify which table is on the one side of the relationship by placing a one next to the field where the line starts.
• Specify which table is on the many sides of the relationship by placing a crow's feet symbol next to the field where the line ends.
